title: Managing dot files with git
---

In [The Imposter's Handbook](https://bigmachine.io/products/the-imposters-handbook), [Rob Conery](https://rob.conery.io/) talks about managing *dot files* in a git repository:

> Most Unix-adept developers treat their scripts and settings with the same respect as any other code: organizing it carefully and versioning it with git. For example, one of my very favorite people is Gary Bernhardt and he keeps [his dot files on Github](https://github.com/garybernhardt/dotfiles).

As a relative newcomer to shell terminals, this was a massive revelation to me... this would allow me to keep my shell on different systems in sync! 

So, I ended up digging into the management of dot files using git and came across this interesting tutorial: [The best way to store your dotfiles: A bare Git repository](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/dotfiles). I have been using this system for a couple of months now without issue.
